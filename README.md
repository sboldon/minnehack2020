# LifePulse â€“ MinneHack 2020

Our project's goal is to enable a wider emergency response network for opiod overdoses. A person is able to access LifePulse directly on their phone, or through their browser and send out a 'pulse' to nearby users of our service alerting them that someone is in need. Emergency services are contacted at the same time.

This allows someone who is witnessing their loved one, friend, or a stranger overdose the ability to reach out to all possible people that are able to help.

Further goals for the project include incorporating LifePulse's emergency services into an informational and community support based app. This would include streamlining access to treatment, sober housing, peer support meetings, and building motivation to stay clean.

With LifePulse, local communities are able to establish a network that could save lives. Our app fosters social good by improving awareness and providing more opportunities for people to help each other.
